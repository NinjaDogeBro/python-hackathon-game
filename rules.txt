Welcome to the UIC Simulator Game!!
The game where you play out the life of a typical CS student
I am your mentor and guide, Sparky D. Dragon
But before you may begin
You must first learn about the mechanics of this game

In the upper right hand corner, you'll see some status bars 
One indicates your stress level 
One represents your overall health
And another your knowledge. 
The actions you take will affect the level of each bar.

This is a To-do list listing all your assignments that must be done before your deadlines.
Click on it to show your todo list
